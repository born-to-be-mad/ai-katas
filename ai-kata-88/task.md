Tasks list:
1) define AI-powered approach for documentation governance. You should update document on docs/ folder with new requirements from the user story. The main goal here is not to get the document updated, but to define an approach how hundreds of documents like that can be updated with help of AI. Consider all the risks and try to resolve them
2) implement backend (java) part for that user story using any AI tool. Define the best approach for such tasks (brownfield, 5-8 story points size, strict requirements, not all corner cases are covered etc.)
3) implement frontend part (reactjs). It should fully align with backend implementation or documentation. Define the best strategy for such type of tasks (backend+frontend)

General task for everybody:
Present your solution. We would like to see a deck of at least a word/excel document with solutions you have tried, which worked and which did not and what else to improve in your current solution.

IMPORTANT:
No need to receive the final updated document or implemented user story. Main goal is to define the best approach how AI can help you with particular tasks
